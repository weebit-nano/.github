Weebit Nano Ltd. is a leading developer and licensor of advanced semiconductor memory technology. The company’s ground-breaking Resistive [RAM](https://www.weebit-nano.com/definition/ram/) ([ReRAM](https://www.weebit-nano.com/definition/reram-or-rram/) or [RRAM](https://www.weebit-nano.com/definition/rram/)) non-volatile memory ([NVM](https://www.weebit-nano.com/definition/non-volatile-memory-nvm/)) addresses the growing need for significantly higher performance and lower power memory solutions in a range of electronic products such as AI, Internet of Things (IoT), wearable devices, automotive, industrial automation, robotics, neuromorphic computing, and many others. For these applications, Weebit ReRAM allows semiconductor memory elements to be significantly faster, less expensive, more reliable, and more energy efficient than those using existing [flash](https://www.weebit-nano.com/definition/flash/) memory solutions. As it is based on fab-friendly materials, the technology can be quickly and easily integrated with existing flows and processes, without the need for special equipment or large investments.
